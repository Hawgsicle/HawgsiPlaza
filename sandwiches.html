      <p>Good job, you made it in. Despite the title of the club being the HawgsiHoagie club, I don't actually make hoagies here, it's just double-decker sandwiches. I thought the name was cooler. Anyways, below you can only find beginner recipes, as I haven't pursued enough of my double-decker passion yet to provide you with behemoths straight out of the double-decker noggin. If you do join the club below, though, you can get access to exclusive recipes I have yet to try out.</p>

      <h2>"The HOTLine"</h2>
        <p>This son of a gun required a c-section to get yanked out of my gut because I knew the turds that were gonna come out of me would make a mother of 7 keel over and die from the pain. This sandwich brings the HEAT! It's got a solemn buffalo chicken undercarriage, and a wack-ya-mama-style top floor that'll give your grill domestic abuse charges. Here's the recipe for one sandwich:<br>
        <br>&#183; 3 slices of white bread, or alternatively, a double decker bun
        <br>&#183; 2 slices of butter
        <br>&#183; 1/2 of a chicken breast
        <br>&#183; A dash of cayenne pepper powder
        <br>&#183; 5-6 jalapeno slices
        <br>&#183; 5-6 habanero slices
        <br>&#183; 3-4 slices of bacon 
        <br>&#183; 1 cup of  your favorite buffalo sauce 
        <br>&#183; 1 slice of colby jack cheese 
        <br>&#183; 1 slice of pepperjack cheese
        <br>&#183; A few crushed up Flamin' Hot chips of your choice 
        <br>&#183; Ranch or Blue Cheese
        <br>&#183; A couple spinach leaves</p>
        <p>This recipe is convenient because the amount of stuff you're putting together is up to you. The philosophy behind the anatomy of the sandwich is evening out the top shelf and the bottom deck with peppers, sauce, and meat. As you also descend deeper into the hellish pits of the sandwich, you get more saucy, sloppy, and spicy. You can essentially build the top layer like a BLT; that's where you're going to be putting your bacon, spinach, jalapenos, slice of colby jack, and ranch or blue cheese. For the bottom, that's where you want the buffalo chicken, habaneros, crushed up Flamin' Hot chips, and pepperjack slice.</p>
        <p>To get yourself started on the chicken, all you wanna do is lightly brown both sides of the breast in butter. Afterwards, pour about 1/4 of a cup of buffalo sauce and simmer the breast until it's thoroughly cooked through. Take that sumbitch out, shred it 'til you bed it, and throw it right back into the buffalo, adding a bit of cayenne pepper, the shredded hot chips, and the rest of the cup of buffalo. If 1/4 cup wasn't enough when you were simmering it, that's fine, just make sure the rest of the cup goes in after the chicken's shredded. Finally, just mildly toast your bread or buns, slap it all together from the bottom up, tune in to some HOTLine, and get your show on the highway to hell.</p>
