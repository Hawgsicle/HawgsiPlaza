      <h2>Homepage</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the HawgsiPlaza! This is the town square of all of the biproducts of my ventures into the unknown. I've spent centuries curating my radio show HOTLine and a misleading and mediocre art career inspired by the depths of my depressive episodes, anxiety attacks, and marijuana overdoses. I also have a hidden place you'll never find because it belongs to me and it's mine and I own it where you can figure out how to make my own special super secret personal double-decker sandwich recipes. I appreciate you finding this hellhole, and as I work on it over time, you'll see it flourish and evolve.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I, Hawgsicle Hawgsicleson LVIth, have first and foremost appreciated the connections one could have with the world, whether it be through breathing fresh air, eating it's inhabitants, or connecting via bluetooth to the upturned soils of society. The spiritual, mental, and physical desires of the human soul-brain-penis are my  main inspiration. There's nothing particular or of value that I actually do for the world, but you've stayed this long so maybe you're here for some sort of enlightenment. In that case, go <a href="https://www.spaghettimonster.org/pages/about/fsm-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read a book</a> or <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3718935/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watch a movie</a>. I was born on October 8, 2004 BCE, and was friends with Oog, the first caveman, the prophet Mohammed, Buddha, and Osama Bin Laden before he started doing all that bad stuff.</p>
